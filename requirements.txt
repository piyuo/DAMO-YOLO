# PyTorch 2.2.x wheels are built against NumPy 1.x. NumPy 2.x triggers
# "A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in NumPy 2.x" and
# subsequent "RuntimeError: Numpy is not available" inside torch when calling
# torch.from_numpy. Pin <2 for now; upgrade torch first before allowing NumPy 2.
